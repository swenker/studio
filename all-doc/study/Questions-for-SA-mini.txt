Q1: NO. It doesn't work. 
    Pipeline operator is divided into two separated parts. And 'sudo' can only take effect on the first part.

Q2: sed -i '1i\This is a string' /home/bill/abc.conf

Q3: go the end of file: GG or SHIFT+G        
    delete current word(space excluded):diw
    delete 5 lines (current line included):5dd
