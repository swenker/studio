Hadoop YARN: A framework for job scheduling and cluster resource management.

High Availability Mode:

Resource Manager
Node Manager

HDFS Federation
--The prior HDFS architecture allows only a single namespace for the entire cluster. A single Namenode manages this namespace. 
  HDFS Federation addresses limitation of the prior architecture by adding support multiple Namenodes/namespaces to HDFS file system.
HDFS:Namenode/Datanode:
NameNode:Name Service and  Block Management--Metadata 
 
DataNode:Storage
Block Pool:A Block Pool is a set of blocks that belong to a single namespace.
ClusterID: A new identifier ClusterID is added to identify all the nodes in the cluster. When a Namenode is formatted, this identifier is provided or auto generated. 
           [This ID should be used for formatting the other Namenodes into the cluster.]

HDFS High Availability Using the Quorum Journal Manager       

HA: two namenode,one is active and the other is standby


EditLog
The NameNode uses a transaction log called the EditLog to persistently record every change that occurs to file system metadata.
For example, creating a new file in HDFS causes the NameNode to insert a record into the EditLog indicating this.
